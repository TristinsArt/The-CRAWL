# **LVL 1**
## [[Players/Austin/Fighting Styles\|Fighting Style]]
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.

## Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

# **LVL 2**
## Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at [[Players/Austin/Fighter#**LVL 17**\|17th]] level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

# **LVL 3**
## Martial Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype from the list available that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at [[Players/Austin/Fighter#**LVL 7**\|7th]], [[Players/Austin/Fighter#**LVL 10**\|10th]], [[Players/Austin/Fighter#**LVL 15**\|15th]], and [[Players/Austin/Fighter#**LVL 18**\|18th]] level.

### _Battle Master_
Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weapon smithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.

### _Student of War_
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of [artisan's tools](https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:phb=1,flstmiscellaneous:mundane=1,flsttype:artisan's%20tools=1) of your choice.

### _Combat Superiority_
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Superiority Die\|Superiority Dice]].

**Maneuvers.** You learn three [[Players/Austin/Maneuvers\|maneuvers]] of your choice, which are listed under "[[Players/Austin/Maneuvers\|Maneuvers]]". Many [[Players/Austin/Maneuvers\|maneuvers]] enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at [[Players/Austin/Fighter#**LVL 7**\|7th]], [[Players/Austin/Fighter#**LVL 10**\|10th]], and [[Players/Austin/Fighter#**LVL 15**\|15th]] level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**Superiority Dice.** You have four [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Superiority Die\|Superiority Dice]], which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Superiority Die\|Superiority Dice]] when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain another [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Superiority Die\|superiority die]] at [[Players/Austin/Fighter#**LVL 7**\|7th]] level and one more at [[Players/Austin/Fighter#**LVL 15**\|15th]] level.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your [[Players/Austin/Maneuvers\|maneuvers]] require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + [[Rules/References/Abilities/Strength\|Strength]] or [[Rules/References/Abilities/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] modifier (your choice) + Proficiency Bonus

### _Maneuver Options_
_3rd-level fighter optional feature_

If you have access to maneuvers, the following maneuvers are added to the list of options available to you. Maneuvers are available to Battle Masters but also to characters who have a special feature like the Superior Technique fighting style or the Martial Adept feat.

# **LVL 4**
## [[Rules/References/Abilities/Ability Score Improvement\|Ability Score Improvement]]
### Martial Versatility
_4th-level fighter optional feature_

- Replace a [[Players/Austin/Fighting Styles\|fighting style]] you know with another fighting style available to fighters.
- If you know any [[Players/Austin/Maneuvers\|maneuvers]] from the Battle Master archetype, you can replace one maneuver you know with a different maneuver.

If you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

- [[Rules/References/Abilities/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] score
- [[Rules/References/Abilities/Constitution\|Constitution]] score
