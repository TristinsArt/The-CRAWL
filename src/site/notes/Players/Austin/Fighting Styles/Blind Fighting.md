You have [[Rules/References/Senses/Blindsight\|blindsight]] with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Cover\|Cover]], even if you're [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]] or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [[Rules/References/Conditions/Invisible\|invisible]] creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
