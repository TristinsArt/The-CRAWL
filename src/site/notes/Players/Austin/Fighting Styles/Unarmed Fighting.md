Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to **1d6** + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a **shield** when you make the attack roll, the **d6** becomes a **d8**.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal **1d4** bludgeoning damage to one creature [[Rules/References/Conditions/Grappled\|grappled]] by you.
