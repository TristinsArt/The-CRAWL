When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the end of your next turn.
