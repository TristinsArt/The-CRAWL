# Superior Darkvision
Accustomed to the depths of the Underdark, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

# Keen Senses
You have proficiency in the [[Rules/References/Skills/Perception\|Perception]] skill.

# Fey Ancestry
You have advantage on saving throws against being [[Rules/References/Conditions/Charmed\|charmed]], and magic can't put you to sleep.

# Trance
Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

*If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.*

# Sunlight Sensitivity
You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

# Drow Magic
You know the [[Spells/Dancing Lights\|dancing lights]] cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[Spells/Faerie Fire\|faerie fire]] spell once with this trait; you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the [[Spells/Darkness\|Darkness]] spell once per day with this trait; you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. [[Rules/References/Abilities/Charisma\|Charisma]] is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
