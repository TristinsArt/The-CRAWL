**Level Required:** 5  


As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through total [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Cover\|Cover]]. It lasts until you're [[Rules/References/Conditions/Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] or you dismiss it as a bonus action.
The aura grants you advantage on [[Rules/References/Abilities/Charisma\|Charisma]] ([[Rules/References/Skills/Intimidation\|Intimidation]]) checks but disadvantage on all other [[Rules/References/Abilities/Charisma\|Charisma]] checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage equal to your [[Rules/References/Abilities/Charisma\|Charisma]] modifier (minimum of 0 damage).
Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
