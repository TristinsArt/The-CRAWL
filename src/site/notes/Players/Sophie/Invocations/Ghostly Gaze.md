**Level Required:** 7  


As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have [[Spells/Darkvision\|Darkvision]] if you don't already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Concentration\|Concentration]] ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.
Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
