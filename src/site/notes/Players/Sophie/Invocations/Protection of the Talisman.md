**Level Required:** 7  
**Prerequisite:** Pact of the Talisman  


When the wearer of your talisman fails a saving throw, they can add a **d4** to the roll, potentially turning the save into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.
