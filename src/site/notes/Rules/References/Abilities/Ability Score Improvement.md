# Ability Score Improvement

An **Ability Score Improvement (ASI)** is a feature gained by most classes at certain levels, allowing you to enhance your character’s capabilities.

## Standard Rules

When you reach a level that grants an ASI (typically levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19 for many classes), you can choose one of the following options:

- Increase one ability score by 2, or
- Increase two ability scores by 1 each

You **cannot** increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

These increases represent your character growing more skilled, knowledgeable, or powerful through experience.

## Optional Versatility Features (Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything)

Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything introduces optional **versatility features** for many classes. When you reach a level that grants an ASI, instead of increasing ability scores, you can choose:

- **A feat** from the official list, if your DM allows the use of feats.
- **An optional class-specific feature**, such as additional spells known or swapped proficiencies.

These alternate features provide flexibility and let you fine-tune your character’s development, adding unique capabilities outside raw ability scores.

## Relevant To

The ASI is relevant to **all classes** including:
- [[Barbarian\|Barbarian]], [[Bard\|Bard]], [[Players/Tim/Cleric\|Cleric]], [[Players/Rayne/Druid\|Druid]], [[Players/Austin/Fighter\|Fighter]], [[Monk\|Monk]], [[Players/Matt/Paladin\|Paladin]], [[Ranger\|Ranger]], [[Rogue\|Rogue]], [[Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]], [[Players/Sophie/Warlock\|Warlock]], and [[Wizard\|Wizard]]

Be sure to consult your class progression table to know when you gain ASI options.

**Note:** Always confirm with your DM whether the **Tasha’s optional rules** are allowed at your table.
