# Armor Class

**Armor Class (AC)** represents how hard it is to hit a creature in combat. It is the number an attacker needs to meet or exceed on an attack roll to deal damage.

## Base Armor Class

A creatureâ€™s AC depends on what armor it wears and other bonuses it may receive.

### Unarmored AC

By default:  
**10 + Dexterity modifier**

### Wearing Armor

- **Light Armor**: Add full Dexterity modifier  
- **Medium Armor**: Add Dexterity modifier up to +2  
- **Heavy Armor**: No Dexterity modifier added

### Shields

Wielding a shield grants a +2 bonus to AC.

## Magic & Features

AC can be modified by:
- Spells like [[Spells/Shield\|Shield]] or [[Spells/Mage Armor\|Mage Armor]]
- Magic items like [[Ring of Protection\|Ring of Protection]] or [[Bracers of Defense\|Bracers of Defense]]
- Class features (e.g. Monk and Barbarian have special unarmored defenses)

## Example

A character in chain mail (AC 16) with a shield (+2 AC) has an AC of **18**.
