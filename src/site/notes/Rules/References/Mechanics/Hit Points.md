# Hit Points

**Hit Points (HP)** represent a character’s health, vitality, and ability to withstand damage. They are determined by your class, Constitution modifier, and level.

## Calculating Hit Points

At 1st level, your HP is the maximum value of your class’s Hit Die plus your Constitution modifier.

For levels beyond 1st, you can:
- Roll your class’s Hit Die and add your Constitution modifier, or
- Take the average value (rounded up) of the die and add your Constitution modifier

## Example:
A level 1 Fighter with 16 Constitution:
- Hit Die: d10
- Constitution Modifier: +3
- HP: 10 + 3 = 13

Each level after 1st: 6 (average of d10) + 3 = 9 HP

## Temporary Hit Points

Some effects grant **temporary hit points**, which absorb damage before regular HP is reduced. They **do not stack**—only the highest value applies.

## Reducing Hit Points

Taking damage reduces your current HP. When you reach 0 HP:
- You fall [[Rules/References/Conditions/Unconscious\|Unconscious]]
- You start making [[Death Saving Throws\|Death Saving Throws]]
- If damage exceeds your max HP in a single hit, you may die instantly

## Healing

Healing restores HP up to your maximum. This can occur through:
- Spells like [[Spells/Cure Wounds\|Cure Wounds]] or [[Spells/Healing Word\|Healing Word]]
- Resting (Short or Long)
- Magic items like [[Potion of Healing\|Potion of Healing]]
