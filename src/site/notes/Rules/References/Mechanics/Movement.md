# Movement

Movement in D&D 5e governs how characters and creatures traverse the battlefield or the world around them. Most characters have a **speed** that defines how far they can move on their turn.

## Walking

This is the default movement type. Your walking speed is determined by your race and can be modified by feats, magic items, or conditions like [[Rules/References/Conditions/Exhaustion\|Exhaustion]] or [[Rules/References/Conditions/Grappled\|Grappled]].

## Climbing

Climbing typically costs **2 feet of movement for every 1 foot climbed**, unless a creature has a climb speed. When climbing, difficult surfaces may require a [[Rules/References/Abilities/Strength\|Strength]] ([[Rules/References/Skills/Athletics\|Athletics]]) check.

## Swimming

Swimming also costs **2 feet of movement for every 1 foot swum**, unless the creature has a swim speed. Rough waters or currents may require a check to traverse.

## Flying

A creature with a fly speed can move through the air. While flying, a creature falls if it is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] or otherwise prevented from moving, unless it can hover or is being held aloft by magic.

## Burrowing

Some creatures can move through earth or sand using a burrow speed. This speed allows them to move through non-solid terrain like loose soil or sand. It does not allow movement through solid stone unless specified.

## Special Movement Options

### Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain costs **twice as much movement** to move through. Effects like the [[Spells/Entangle\|Entangle]] spell or rugged environments may create difficult terrain.

### Crawling

If you are prone, you must **crawl** to move, which costs **1 extra foot per foot moved**, unless you stand up first.

### Jumping

Jumping is based on your [[Rules/References/Abilities/Strength\|Strength]] score and follows specific rules for long and high jumps.

#### Long Jump
When you make a **long jump**, you cover a number of feet up to your **Strength score** if you move at least **10 feet on foot immediately before the jump**.
- Example: With a Strength score of 15, you can long jump up to 15 feet with a running start.
- If you **don’t move at least 10 feet** before jumping, you can only jump **half** that distance.
**Note:** You can’t jump farther than your remaining movement allows during your turn.

#### High Jump
When you make a **high jump**, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to **3 + your Strength modifier** if you move at least **10 feet** on foot immediately before the jump.

- Example: With a Strength modifier of +2, you can high jump up to 5 feet off the ground.
- If you **don’t take a running start**, you can only jump **half** that height.

You can reach up an additional **1½ feet** with your arms while high jumping (unless otherwise limited by the DM).

#### Special Considerations

- **Jumping over obstacles** may require an [[Rules/References/Skills/Athletics\|Athletics]] check depending on their height, slipperiness, or instability.
- **Encumbrance**, **conditions** like [[Rules/References/Conditions/Grappled\|Grappled]] or [[Rules/References/Conditions/Exhaustion\|Exhaustion]], and **terrain** can affect jumping.
- Magic like [[Spells/Jump\|Jump]] or [[Spells/Enhance Ability\|Enhance Ability]] can enhance jumping capabilities.
- A creature can’t jump more than the distance remaining in its [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Movement\|Movement]] for the turn, unless using teleportation or flight.

### Teleportation

Teleportation is instantaneous movement without crossing the space in between. It typically does not provoke opportunity attacks and ignores terrain. See spells like [[Spells/Misty Step\|Misty Step]] and [[Spells/Dimension Door\|Dimension Door]].

### Forced Movement

Forced movement (such as being pushed, pulled, or knocked prone) does **not provoke opportunity attacks** and does not consume your movement.

Movement is a fundamental part of tactical gameplay. Consider your surroundings, terrain, and available movement types each turn for optimal positioning.
