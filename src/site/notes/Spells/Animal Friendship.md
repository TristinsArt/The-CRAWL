This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be [[Rules/References/Conditions/Charmed\|charmed]] by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.
