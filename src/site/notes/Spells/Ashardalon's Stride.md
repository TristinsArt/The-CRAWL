The billowing flames of a dragon blast from your feet, granting you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 20 feet and moving doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
When you move within 5 feet of a creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried, it takes **1d6** fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.
