You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides _"Coverthree-quarters cover"_ to creatures behind it, and its space is [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Movement#difficult terrain\|difficult terrain]].
When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes **6d10** slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
