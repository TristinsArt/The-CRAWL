The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra **3d8** radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]] until the spell ends.
A creature [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]] by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]].
