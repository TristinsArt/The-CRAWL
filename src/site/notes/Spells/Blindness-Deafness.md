You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]] or [[Rules/References/Conditions/Deafened\|deafened]] (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.
