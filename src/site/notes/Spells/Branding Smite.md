The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra **2d6** radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it's [[Rules/References/Conditions/Invisible\|invisible]], and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can't become [[Rules/References/Conditions/Invisible\|invisible]] until the spell ends.
