You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall [[Rules/References/Conditions/Unconscious\|unconscious]] for the spell's duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains [[Rules/References/Conditions/Unconscious\|unconscious]] for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.
