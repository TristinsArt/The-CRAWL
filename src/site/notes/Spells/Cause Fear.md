You awaken the sense of mortality in one creature you can see within range. A construct or an undead is immune to this effect. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [[Rules/References/Conditions/Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the spell ends. The [[Rules/References/Conditions/Frightened\|frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
