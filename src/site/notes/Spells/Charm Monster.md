You attempt to charm a creature you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and it does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Charmed\|charmed]] by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The [[Rules/References/Conditions/Charmed\|charmed]] creature is friendly to you. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [[Rules/References/Conditions/Charmed\|charmed]] by you.
