Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Poisoned\|poisoned]].
At the end of each of the [[Rules/References/Conditions/Poisoned\|poisoned]] target's turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer [[Rules/References/Conditions/Poisoned\|poisoned]], and the spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer [[Rules/References/Conditions/Poisoned\|poisoned]], but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell's duration.
Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.
**_Blinding Sickness_**
Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]].
**_Filth Fever_**
A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.
**_Flesh Rot_**
The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.
**_Mindfire_**
The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the [[Spells/Confusion\|Confusion]] spell during combat.
**_Seizure_**
The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.
**_Slimy Doom_**
The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Stunned\|stunned]] until the end of its next turn.
