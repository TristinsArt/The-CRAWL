You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take **5d6** thunder damage, as well as **5d6** radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked [[Rules/References/Conditions/Prone\|prone]]. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[Rules/References/Conditions/Prone\|prone]].
