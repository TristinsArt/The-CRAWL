A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by [[Spells/Wall of Force\|Wall of Force]].
A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes **10d6 + 40** force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.
A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [[Spells/True Resurrection\|True Resurrection]] or a [[Spells/Wish\|Wish]] spell.
This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.
**_At Higher Levels_**
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 10d6 + 40|6-9|3d6 for each slot level above 6th.
