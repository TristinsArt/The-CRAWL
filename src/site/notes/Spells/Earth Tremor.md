You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **1d6** bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[Rules/References/Conditions/Prone\|prone]]. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Movement#difficult terrain\|difficult terrain]] until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
