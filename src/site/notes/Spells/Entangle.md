Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into _"difficult terrain||3"_.
A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [[Rules/References/Conditions/Restrained\|restrained]] by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature [[Rules/References/Conditions/Restrained\|restrained]] by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
