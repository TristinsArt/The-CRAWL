Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes **3d12** bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Movement#difficult terrain\|difficult terrain]] until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
