**Level:** 4th-level
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 90 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)
**Duration:** 1 minute
**School:** [[Spells/Schools of Magic/Conjuration\|Conjuration]]

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Movement#difficult terrain\|difficult terrain]].
When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take **3d6** bludgeoning damage and be [[Rules/References/Conditions/Restrained\|restrained]] by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already [[Rules/References/Conditions/Restrained\|restrained]] by the tentacles takes **3d6** bludgeoning damage.
A creature [[Rules/References/Conditions/Restrained\|restrained]] by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
