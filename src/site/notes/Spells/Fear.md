You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become [[Rules/References/Conditions/Frightened\|frightened]] for the duration.
While [[Rules/References/Conditions/Frightened\|frightened]] by this spell, a creature must take the [[Rules/References/Actions/Dash\|Dash]] action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
