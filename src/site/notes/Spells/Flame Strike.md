A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes **4d6** fire damage and **4d6** radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
