**Level:** 5th-level
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 1 hour
**School:** [[Spells/Schools of Magic/Evocation\|Evocation]]

You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra **2d8** radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **4d8** radiant damage, and it is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]]. At the end of each of its turns, a [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]] creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
