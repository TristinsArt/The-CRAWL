You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [[Rules/References/Conditions/Charmed\|charmed]] for the duration. While [[Rules/References/Conditions/Charmed\|charmed]] by this spell, the creature is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] and has a speed of 0.
The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
