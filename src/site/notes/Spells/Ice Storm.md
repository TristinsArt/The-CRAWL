A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes **2d8** bludgeoning damage and **4d6** cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into _"difficult terrain||3"_ until the end of your next turn.
