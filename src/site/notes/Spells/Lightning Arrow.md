The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition, or the weapon itself if it's a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes **4d8** lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's normal damage.
Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes **2d8** lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.
