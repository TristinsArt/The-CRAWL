Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with [[Spells/Darkvision\|Darkvision]] can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.
Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking **8d8** psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
