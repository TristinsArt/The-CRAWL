Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [[Rules/References/Conditions/Charmed\|charmed]], [[Rules/References/Conditions/Frightened\|frightened]], or possessed by them. If the target is already [[Rules/References/Conditions/Charmed\|charmed]], [[Rules/References/Conditions/Frightened\|frightened]], or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
