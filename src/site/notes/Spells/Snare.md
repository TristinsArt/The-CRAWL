**Level:** 1st-level
**Casting Time:** 1 minute
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** 8 hours
**School:** [[Spells/Schools of Magic/Abjuration\|Abjuration]]

As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.
This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence ([[Rules/References/Skills/Investigation\|Investigation]]) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.
The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Restrained\|restrained]] there until the spell ends.
A [[Rules/References/Conditions/Restrained\|restrained]] creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence ([[Rules/References/Skills/Arcana\|Arcana]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the [[Rules/References/Conditions/Restrained\|restrained]] effect ends.
After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Restrained\|restrained]] by it.
