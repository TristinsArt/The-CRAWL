Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **12d6** radiant damage and is [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]] by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.
A creature [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]] by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [[Rules/References/Conditions/Blinded\|blinded]].
This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
