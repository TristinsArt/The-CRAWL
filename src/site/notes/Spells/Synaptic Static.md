You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes **8d6** psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain [[Rules/References/Mechanics/Concentration\|concentration]]. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
