**Level:** 9th-level

**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 1 minute (Concentration)
**School:** [[Spells/Schools of Magic/Illusion\|Illusion]]

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes [[Rules/References/Conditions/Frightened\|frightened]] for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the [[Rules/References/Conditions/Frightened\|frightened]] creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take **4d10** psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
